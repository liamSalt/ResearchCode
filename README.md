# ResearchCode
Collection of some of the Magma and Python code used during my thesis research at SFU

- "Arbitrary ILP.txt" tests whether any set of vectors and bases form a ks pair. Default is to use all possible oorthogonality relations.

- "CKinvariant.txt" shows that Conway-Kochen Vectors are invariant under the action of a particular group

- "CortezVectors.txt" list of vectors which were only implicitly defined in paper

- "GraphKS" Graph theory based approach outlined in thesis

- "GroupAction.txt" tests whether the Tahara groups give KS pairs

- "Jungnickel3.txt" generates the (normalized) hadamard matrices from the Jungnickel construction

- "KSpairs.txt" collection of some specific KS pairs, including the size 31 sets

- "Paley-Hadamard3.txt" generates the (normalized) hadamard matrices from the Paley construction

- "projectivity.txt" code to find group fixing set of lines

- "size31symGroups.txt" groups that fix the 6 size-31 KS pairs found in "KSpairs.txt" (including the original Conway-Kochen set). There are three distinct groups given, each fixing exactly two of the sets.

- "ssLP.txt" main code used for the Hadamard matrix portion of the thesis

- "TaharaGroups.txt" List of all the groups found in the Tahara paper + checks for accuracy

- "vecLP.txt" checks for KS pairs related to the Cortez-Reyes paper
